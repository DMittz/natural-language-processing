# Spam Detector

The Spam Detector project implements a machine learning model trained using Naive Bayes Neural Network. This model has been trained on a dataset of over 5000 emails to analyze and classify incoming emails as either 'spam' or 'not spam'. Through the training process, the neurons of the model are sufficiently trained to independently predict and classify new incoming emails with high accuracy.

## Description
<ul>
<li>The Spam Detector employs a Naive Bayes Neural Network trained on a dataset of 5000+ emails to classify incoming emails as 'spam' or 'not spam'.</li>
<li>The model utilizes the principles of Naive Bayes to calculate the probability of an email being spam based on the presence of certain features in the email content.</li>
</ul>

## Cyberbullying Detector

The Cyberbullying Detector project implements machine learning models trained using parameterized Decision Tree Classifier (DTC) and Neural Networks. These models are trained on a dataset of 11,100 labeled messages, comments, and remarks. The dataset is evenly split between instances of cyberbullying and safe content. Through the training process, both the DTC and Neural Networks are optimized to accurately classify new online messages as either cyberbullying or safe.
